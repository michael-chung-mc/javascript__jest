## About The Project
The Odin Project Knight Travails

Assignment Details:

Show shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way

### Built With
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS

## Roadmap
- [ ] Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
- [ ] Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.
- [ ] Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
- [ ] Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:
```
    > knightMoves([3,3],[4,3])\
    => You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:\
        [3,3]\
        [4,5]\
        [2,4]\
        [4,3]
```
