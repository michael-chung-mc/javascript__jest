# theodinproject--recursion-fibonacci
Warmup: Fibonacci
The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

1. Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
2. Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).
